# Programs Included
- Matplotlib Graphing Bar.py : Use this to count occurrences in one row of a csv
- Matplotlib Graphing XY Heatmap.py : A more complicated version of a scatter plot. Plot x-y coordinates in a grid and smooth data (requires numerical data)
- Matplotlib Graphing Hexbin.py : Similar to the Heatmap. Instead of smoothing data, will plot data based on a hex grid (requires numerical data)
- Matplotlib Graphing XY Linear.py : Very basic x-y relationships and graphs a linear plot (requires numerical data)
- Matplotlib Graphing XY Scatter/Scatter - Optimized.py : Please use the optimized version, it is a much faster scatter plot (requires numerical data)
- Matplotlib Graphing XYZ Linear.py
